A typical README.md file will include sections like the following: 

Project Title: e.g., # Tic Tac Toe Game
Description: A brief overview of the project, e.g., "A simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript".

Features:
Clean and intuitive user interface.
Real-time updates on game progress.
Responsive design.
Reset button to start a new game.

How to Play:
Open index.html in your web browser.
Click on any empty cell to make your move (players usually alternate X and O).
The first player to get three of their symbols in a row wins.
If all cells are filled and no one wins, the game is a draw.
